# Executive Summary

This document cuts through AI agent hype to provide practical guidance for federal and enterprise audiences. It establishes common vocabulary, demonstrates working patterns, and offers principles you can apply immediately.

## The Core Message

**Bounded agency beats autonomous agents.**

The fantasy of fully autonomous AI agents running unsupervised is exactly that: fantasy. In practice, production systems in 2025-2026 treat agents as bounded, auditable components with explicit constraints, confidence thresholds, and human oversight points.

This document teaches that approach.

## What You'll Learn

**Vocabulary (Chapter 3):** Precise definitions for workflow, agent, agency, and agentic. These terms get thrown around loosely. Shared definitions prevent confusion.

**Basic Pipeline (Chapter 4):** A recipe-to-grocery-list workflow demonstrating observe-decide-act-check in practice. Simple enough to understand in minutes. Runnable with copy-paste.

**Prompt as Script (Chapter 5):** How to build functional agents without frameworks, APIs, or developer tools. A structured prompt in a chat interface is a legitimate architecture pattern. This matters because most readers can't install software on work computers anyway.

**Case Study (Chapter 6):** The Federal Survey Concept Mapper pipeline. Real federal workflow demonstrating dual-model cross-validation, confidence-based arbitration, and human review fail-safes. Shows bounded agency at production scale.

**Design Principles (Chapter 7):** Six principles that should stay with you:
1. Without good judgment in upfront design, junk probability skyrockets
2. Agency requires governance, not just capability
3. Most problems don't need agents (and that's fine)
4. The skill is describing what you want and spotting bad design
5. Design for uncertainty
6. Break tasks into digestible chunks

## Who This Is For

- Federal and enterprise staff exploring AI agent capabilities
- Teams evaluating whether agents fit their workflows
- Non-technical professionals who need to specify and evaluate AI systems
- Anyone tired of hype who wants practical, grounded guidance

## How to Use This Document

**If you have 20 minutes:** Read the vocabulary chapter and skim the design principles.

**If you have an hour:** Work through the basic pipeline and try the prompt yourself.

**If you're implementing:** Use the templates in Appendix B as starting points for your own agent documentation.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need expensive tools or deep technical skills to work with AI agents effectively. You need clear thinking, well-structured prompts, and appropriate skepticism about what automation can and should do.

Start simple. Add complexity only when justified. Design for uncertainty. Keep humans in the loop where it matters.

That's it. The rest is practice.
