# Introduction

## The Problem: Hype, Confusion, and Expensive Mistakes

AI agents are everywhere right now. Or at least, the *talk* about AI agents is everywhere. LinkedIn is full of people telling you about the "7 types of agents you need to know" or the "ultimate agentic workflow that will 10x your productivity." 

Most of it is noise.

The real problem isn't that agents are overhyped — it's that people are making significant decisions without a shared understanding of what these terms actually mean. When someone says "let's use an AI agent for this," does everyone in the room picture the same thing? Usually not.

This confusion has real costs.

In September 2025, Salesforce cut approximately 4,000 customer support employees — nearly half their support staff — citing their AI product "Agentforce" as the reason. CEO Marc Benioff was explicit: AI was handling the workload, so they needed fewer people. By December, reports emerged that leadership had been "more confident than they should have been" about AI's ability to replace experienced staff. Service gaps, quality issues, and reliability problems followed. They had to walk it back.

Salesforce is a massive company with enormous resources, selling their *own* AI agent product. And they still got caught by the gap between expectations and reality.

**The idea:** You'll see the same core concepts three times — each time with more context. By the end, the vocabulary should feel like tools you can use, not jargon to memorize.

## What This Document Provides

This isn't a comprehensive course on building AI agents. It's a practical guide to understanding what people mean when they use these terms, so you can:

- Participate in conversations without getting spun around
- Evaluate claims and cut through marketing hype
- Make better decisions about where agents might (or might not) help
- Know enough to learn more if you want to

We'll cover a small vocabulary, show you what these concepts look like in practice, and give you a concrete example from real work.

## A Note on Expectations

Some limitations of AI agents are temporary — the technology is evolving fast. Other limitations are more fundamental and won't disappear with the next model release. Understanding the difference matters.

If you're curious about this space, now is a reasonable time to start learning. It's easier to grow with the technology than to catch up later. But there's no pressure here. If you dig in and decide this isn't for you, that's fine. There are plenty of useful things to learn in the world. This document will still be here if you want to come back to it.

The goal is a baseline — common vocabulary, a few concrete examples, and enough grounding to make your own decisions.

Let's start with the vocabulary.
