# Working Notes

Tracking decisions and rationale as we develop this handout.

## Main Ideas (to surface explicitly)

1. Without good judgment in upfront design, junk probability skyrockets
2. Autonomy is a governance choice, not a technical upgrade
3. Most problems don't need agents (and that's fine)
4. The skill is describing what you want and spotting bad design
5. Design for uncertainty:
   - Design for what goes wrong, not just what goes right
   - Build in checkpoints
   - Know when it should stop and ask

## Pedagogical Approach

- Three-pass repetition: vocab → basic example → script → case study
- Vocabulary in "pure" form first, nuance comes through examples
- 80% comprehension target for general audience
- Handout stands alone; talk is the launch event
- Material designed to be stolen and taught by others

## Constraints

- No employer mention
- No endorsements
- Living document disclaimer
- Shadow IT reality: most audience can't access proper tooling at work
- Avoid em-dash overuse
- No emojis

## Style

- Write like talking, but clean
- Grounded, not cheerleading or fear-mongering
- Permission to walk away if not for them
- Show limitations (some temporary, some fundamental)

## Open Questions

- (Add as they arise)

## HANDOFF: Lit Review Phase

After completing section drafts, conduct research phase:

### Process
1. Use Perplexity.ai to gather latest research and best practices on AI agents
2. Document findings with citations in an appendix
3. Cross-reference against our content

### Goals
1. **Alignment check:** Ensure content matches latest knowledge
2. **Level check:** Keep appropriate for beginners, show progression paths
3. **Gap analysis:** Find missing pieces worth adding
4. **Pruning candidates:** Identify content to cut or move to appendix

### Appendix Structure (to create)
- `10_appendix_research.md` - Lit review findings with citations
- Or multiple appendices if topics warrant separation

### Citation Format
- Include source, date accessed, key finding
- Note if finding supports, contradicts, or extends our content
