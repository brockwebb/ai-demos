## About This Document

This handout accompanies a short presentation on AI agents, agentic behavior, and practical design considerations. It is designed to:

- Establish common vocabulary for discussing AI agents
- Provide concrete examples at increasing levels of complexity
- Stand alone as a reference for those who did not attend the presentation
- Be stolen, shared, and taught from freely

The goal is not mastery — it's baseline understanding and a common language.

**If you want to teach this material:** Take it. Adapt it. Make it your own. Attribution appreciated but not required.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Tam Nguyen for generous feedback that improved these materials—including flagging "circuit breaker" as important emerging terminology for agentic AI safety. Thanks also to the broader AI practitioner community for the culture of sharing knowledge and helping each other figure this out as we go.
