## The Problem

**Everyone is talking about AI agents. Few agree on what the terms mean.**

When someone says "let's use an AI agent for this" — does everyone in the room picture the same thing?

Usually not.

---

## The Salesforce Lesson

- **September 2025:** Cut ~4,000 support staff citing AI product "Agentforce"
- **December 2025:** Leadership had been "more confident than they should have been"
- Service gaps, quality issues, reliability problems followed

**They sell the AI product. They still got caught by the gap between expectations and reality.**

---

## What We'll Cover

1. **Vocabulary** — shared definitions for the terms that matter
2. **Live Demo** — see the concepts in a simple workflow
3. **Case Study** — bounded agency at scale (briefly)
4. **Design Principles** — what to remember when the details fade

---

## Core Vocabulary

| Term | What It Is | Key Question |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Workflow** | Structure, sequence of steps | What's the process? |
| **Agent** | Entity that does work | What's doing the work? |
| **Agency** | Granted decision-making authority | What decisions can it make? |
| **Agentic** | Behavior where agency is exercised | How much can it adapt? |
| **Tool** | Single discrete operation | What can it do? |

---

## The Loop

The heartbeat of agent behavior:

![](../img/the_loop.png){height=400}

**Observe → Decide → Act → Check → (repeat)**

Every framework, every tool — this pattern remains constant.

---

## Agentic Is a Dial, Not a Switch

![](../img/autonomy_dial.png){height=450}

**Move right only when you have to. Stay left when you can.**

---

## The Loop in Practice

A recipe assistant — simple enough to understand, complex enough to be useful.

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **OBSERVE** | User says "I want to make chicken cacciatore" |
| **DECIDE** | Which recipe meets criteria? (4+ stars, reputable source) |
| **ACT** | Search → Select → Extract ingredients → Generate list |
| **CHECK** | Allergen conflict? User has items? Goal met? |

The loop repeats until done — or until it needs to stop and ask.

---

## Live Demo: Recipe Workflow {.plain}

---

## What Makes It Agentic?

- **Decision points with criteria** — which recipe? (4+ stars, reputable source)
- **Conditional branching** — allergen check is a hard stop
- **Iteration** — "anything you already have?" creates a refinement loop
- **Transparency** — "explain why you chose it"

This is a **workflow with bounded agency**, not an autonomous agent.

## Case Study: Multi-Survey Concept Mapper

6,987 questions across 46 surveys → mapped to Census topic and subtopic lists

## Why Bounded Agency?

| Autonomous Agent Approach | This Workflow |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| One model decides everything | Cross-validation catches errors |
| Confidence is implicit | Confidence tiers are explicit |
| Edge cases get guessed | Edge cases get flagged |
| Failures are silent | Failures are surfaced |

**Result:** 99.5% success rate, ~$15 total cost*, complete audit trail.

*\*Reality check: That was the working version. Getting there took ~8 hours of setup, testing, failures, and restarts. Always start with a small sample run. It's a do-loop until done right.*

## Design Principles

| # | Principle | One-Liner |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Good judgment upfront | Design quality bounds output quality |
| 2 | Agency requires governance | Less agency is often better |
| 3 | Most problems don't need agents | Simple solutions beat complex ones |
| 4 | Specification is the skill | Clarity beats capability |
| 5 | Design for uncertainty | Plan for failure, not just success |
| 6 | Digestible chunks | Focused beats sprawling |

---

## The Stakes: What Ignoring These Causes

Microsoft's AI Red Team documented failure modes in agentic systems.^[Microsoft AI Red Team, *Taxonomy of Failure Modes in Agentic AI Systems* (2025)]

Nearly every one traces back to violating these principles:

| Ignore This... | ...And Get This |
|----------------|----------------|
| Good judgment upfront | Misalignment, hallucinations, misinterpretation |
| Agency requires governance | Actions outside scope, user harm |
| Simple solutions first | Attack surface, knowledge loss |
| Clear specifications | Wrong permissions, accountability gaps |
| Designing for uncertainty | Cascading failures, denial of service |

**These principles aren't caution. They're how you build systems that work.**

---

## The Meta-Principle

![](../img/design_quality.png){height=250}

**AI amplifies your process.** Good process + AI = faster good outcomes.

The test: **Would I sign my name under this action?**

---

## The Bottom Line

You don't need expensive tools or deep technical skills to work with AI agents effectively. You need:

- Clear thinking
- Well-structured prompts
- Appropriate skepticism about what automation can and should do

**Start simple. Add complexity only when justified. Design for uncertainty. Keep humans in the loop where it matters.**

*That's it. The rest is practice.*
